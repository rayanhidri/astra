"""
ETL-side writer for EQUIVAUT_A relationships.

CONTRACT
--------
This module is the ONLY place in the ETL pipeline allowed to write or
delete EQUIVAUT_A edges. All operations here are restricted to
`source = 'inferred'`.

Edges with `source = 'official'` or `source = 'request'` are owned by
the API (admin endpoints, request workflow). The ETL must never see them.

If you find yourself needing to bypass this restriction in an ETL script,
stop — the equivalence belongs to a different lifecycle and should be
written via the API instead.
